Learn the difference between `use`, `alias`, `import` and `require` in Elixir. Based on this [post](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/use-import-require-in-elixir/)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add use_import_require to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:use_import_require, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure use_import_require is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:use_import_require]]
        end
